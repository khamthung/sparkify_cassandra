# Sparkify
This project demonstrate ETL process for song analysis by using song and log dataset, load into new fact and dimension table. The goal at the end will be able to find the songs that was played the whole length. This could lead us to analyze more insight of each song such as how many time of the week, month and year that song have been played.

**To begin process**, run `create_tables.py` and `etl.py` then test the queries results on `test.ipynb`


## The Dataset
### Song Dataset 
A subset of real data from the [Million Song](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```python
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```
### Log Dataset 
This dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Database Schema
Using the song and log datasets to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table
1. songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page `NextSong`
    * songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables
2. **users** - users in the app
    * user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
3. **songs** - songs in music database
    * song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. **artists** - artists in music database
    * artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
5. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    * start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Project Files

1. **test.ipynb** displays the first few rows of each table to check database.
2. **create_tables.py** drops and creates your tables. Run this file first to reset database and table before running ETL scripts.
3. **etl.ipynb** This notebook show ETL process to reads single file from `song_data` and `log_data` and loads the data into tables. 
4. **etl.py** ETL Pipeline to loop through entire subset data from `song_data` and `log_data`, reads and processes files then loads into tables. 
5. **sql_queries.py** contains all sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.

## Results

* **Songplays**
![alt text](images/songplays.png "Schema")
Since this is a subset of the much larger dataset, the solution dataset will only have 1 row with values for value containing ID for both songid and artistid in the fact table. Those are the only 2 values that the query in the sql_queries.py will return that are not-NONE. The rest of the rows will have NONE values for those two variables.![alt text](images/songplays_find.png "Schema")
